# 🧑‍🍳 Gastronome – Recipe, Books, and Courses Manager

Chef is a no-auth cooking application designed for people who want to store, discover, and manage recipes, books, and cooking courses. It allows full CRUD on personal content, supports global discovery, and includes cooking tools like ingredient substitution and measure conversion.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (deployed on Vercel)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui
- **State**: zustand
- **Storage**: localStorage (per user)
- **Testing**: Playwright / Vitest / Testing Library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Theme Support
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Vercel

## 🔄 Data Structure (Scopes)

- **Global Scope**: Discover content shared by anyone
- **User Scope**: Copy & customize global content

Each object (Recipe, Book, Course) in the user scope is a copy, so edits don’t affect the original.
