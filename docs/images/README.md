## 🔧 Alternative Image Hosting

If you prefer not to store images in the repository:

### **GitHub Issues Method**
1. Create a GitHub issue in your repository
2. Drag and drop images into the issue description
3. Copy the generated URLs (format: `https://github.com/user/repo/assets/...`)
4. Replace the paths in README.md with these URLs
5. You can close the issue after copying URLs

### **External Hosting**
- **Imgur**: Free image hosting, but images may expire
- **GitHub Assets**: Most reliable for repository documentation
- **Vercel**: Can serve images from your deployed app

## 📝 Updating README

After adding screenshots, the markdown in README.md will automatically display them:
